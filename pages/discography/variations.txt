title: "Variations"

type: text

!An adventurous programme of twentieth and twenty-first century variations for piano. From the majestic *Chaconne* by Sofia Gubaidulina, to the impassioned virtuosity of Szymanowski's Variations, this disc presents a fresh perspective on the genre.

*The Observer* cited the album's "dazzling" displays of invention, *Gramophone* described Clare as a "pianist of extraordinary gifts" and *The Times* noted her "immense power, tightly harnessed now to the moment's expressive needs". *Crescendo (Belgium)* described her as "one of the most exploratory pianistic personalities of our time".

Clare performed an accompanying series of recitals in schools and prisons, generously support by [Arts Council England](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/) and the [Scops Arts Trust](https://www.scopsartstrust.org.uk/). You can read more about these [here](/static/pdf/discography/variations/school-prison-concerts.pdf) and listen to an extended feature on the disc for 'L'Ã©cho des Pavanes' on RTS Espace 2 below.
