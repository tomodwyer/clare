type: text

For her fifth release with [BIS Records][1], Clare Hammond has constructed an adventurous programme of twentieth and twenty-first-century variations for piano. From the imposing *Chaconne* by Sofia Gubaidulina, to the tender grief of Paul Hindemith’s *Variations* or Aaron Copland’s bold and uncompromising proclamation, the album presents a fresh perspective on the genre.

Hammond opens with Karol Szymanowski’s *Variations on a Polish Theme* from 1904, a virtuosic and intensely Romantic outpouring that contrasts strikingly with the wit and irreverence of Helmut Lachenmann’s set on a theme by Schubert. The most recent works in the programme are Harrison Birtwistle’s mercurial elegy and its polar opposite *I Still Play*, a lyrical waltz composed in 2017 by John Adams.

The disc is available from [BIS Records][1], [eClassical][2], [Presto Classical][3], [Amazon][4] and on [digital platforms][5]. 'Variations' was selected as one of Apple Music's [10 Classical Albums you must hear][6] in March 2021.
