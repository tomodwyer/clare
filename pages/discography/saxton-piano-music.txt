type: text

!*Hortus Musicae*, an exploration of allegorical or metaphysical gardens, forms the centrepiece of this programme. Opening with the imposing *Chacony* for left hand and Saxton's Piano Sonata, we close with a touching lullaby for Clare's first child, Rosa. 

*BBC Music Magazine* praised this "exhilarating reading from Hammond", *Arcana FM* cited Saxton's "evocative and arresting musical imagery", and *The Sunday Times* selected it as one of their Top 10 contemporary albums for 2018.
