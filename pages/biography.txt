!Acclaimed as a “pianist of extraordinary gifts” (<em>Gramophone</em>) and “immense power” (<em>The Times</em>), Clare Hammond is recognised for the virtuosity and authority of her performances. In 2016, she won the Royal Philharmonic Society's 'Young Artist Award' in recognition of outstanding achievement and in 2020 she was engaged to perform at the International Piano Series (Southbank Centre). Performances during the pandemic included recitals for the Wigmore Hall and Aldeburgh Music, a live recital broadcast for BBC Radio 3 Lunchtime Concerts from St David’s Cardiff, and broadcast recordings of Moussa and Carwithen with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (Geoffrey Paterson) and BBC Concert Orchestra (Gavin Sutherland).

During 2020-21, Clare was engaged to perform with the Britten Sinfonia (Ryan Wigglesworth), Sinfonia Varsovia (Jacek Kaspszyk), Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (Christoph Altstaedt) and the BBC Symphony Orchestra (Dalia Stasevska). In recent seasons, she has performed with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (Vasily Petrenko), Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra (Jacek Kaspszyk), and Philharmonia (Jamie Phillips). Clare gave the world premiere of Uncoiling The River by Kenneth Hesketh with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (Martyn Brabbins) and released the Complete Keyboard Works of Myslivecek with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra (Nicholas McGegan) for BIS Records in 2019.

Clare’s discs for BIS have been widely praised with her latest, <em>Variations</em>, receiving extensive critical approval. The disc was commended for its “shimmering pianism and lightly-worn virtuosity” (<em>BBC Music Magazine</em>) and “artistry of the highest order” (<em>Musical Opinion</em>), while <em>Crescendo</em> (Belgium) hailed her as “one of the most exploratory pianistic personalities of our time”. Clare’s discography includes world premiere recordings of over twenty works.

Contemporary music is at the core of Clare’s work and she has given over 50 world premieres, including those of major works by composers Kenneth Hesketh, Arlene Sierra, Robert Saxton and Michael Berkeley.  An active chamber musician, Clare works regularly with the Carducci Quartet and Henning Kraggerud, and has started a new collaboration presenting lyric dramas with actor Tama Matheson. In 2018, she developed <em>Ghosts & Whispers</em>, a performance piece for piano and film, in collaboration with composer John Woolrich and animators, the Quay Brothers.

Community engagement forms an increasingly important part of Clare’s work. Since 2017, she has performed to over 6,600 schoolchildren in partnership with Gloucestershire Music and Wye Valley Music in Schools. She frequently gives children’s concerts and masterclasses at festivals in the UK and France, and runs an ongoing series of recitals at prisons.

Clare completed a BA at Cambridge University, where she obtained a double first in music, and undertook postgraduate study with Ronan O’Hora at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and with Professor Rhian Samuel at City University London. She completed a doctorate on twentieth-century left-hand piano concertos in 2012. In 2014 Clare was paired with French pianist Anne Queffélec on the Philip
Langridge Mentoring Scheme run by the Royal Philharmonic Society.

Clare is grateful for the support of the RVW Trust, Hinrichsen Foundation, John S Cohen Foundation, Arts Council England, Scops Arts Trust, Golsoncott Foundation, Gemma Classical Music Trust, Fidelio Charitable Trust, Help Musicians UK, Stradivari Trust, Ambache Charitable Trust, British Korean Society, Chandos Memorial Trust, Vernon Ellis Foundation, Polish Cultural Institute, British Council, and the Britten-Pears Foundation.
