title: Poesis - Concert Plays
---
type: text

! Fusing words and music to explore the motivations, struggles and desires of some of our greatest cultural figures

Clare is collaborating with actor [Tama Matheson](https://www.tamamatheson.com/) on a series of concert-plays that combine words and music to explore and illuminate the lives of composers and writers.

Their first performance was of *His Quest for Peace - Andrzej Panufnik* at the Barnes Music Festival in May 2021. Featuring music by Andrzej and Roxanna Panufnik, Chopin and Stravinsky, the play follows Panufnik as he struggles to find an artistic voice in a world where free speech is forbidden. Filled with funny, shocking, and tragic incidents - including confrontations with Nazi overlords, and a high-speed car-chase that would be the envy of a Hollywood blockbuster - it explores the horrors of tyranny, the power of art, and the triumph of the human spirit over tribulation.

Future projects include plays on the lives of Bach, Britten and Byron.
