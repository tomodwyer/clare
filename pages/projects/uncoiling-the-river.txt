type: text

! *Uncoiling the River* is a work by [Kenneth Hesketh](http://www.kennethhesketh.co.uk/) for piano and orchestra, co-commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra with support from the RVW Trust. Clare gave the world premiere with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and Martyn Brabbins in Jan 2019 at the Hoddinott Hall in Cardiff, and performed it again with the RLPO and Vasily Petrenko in Liverpool in Jan 2020. BBC Radio 3 broadcast the first performance on the New Music Show in Feb 2020.

The title is both poetic and descriptive, outlining the formal plan the work follows; a ‘toccata’ figure is constantly bent and reconstituted, evolving through expansion and contraction alongside a number of strata that are juxtaposed or superimposed as the work unfolds. *Uncoiling the River is 24 minutes long*.
