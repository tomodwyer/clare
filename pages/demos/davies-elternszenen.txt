ix. To Joy

When discussing ideas for a new work, Clare and I ended up talking about parenthood - a relatively new experience for her and one that is two decades old for me. As a result of this common experience we decided to make the new work about parenthood and model it on Schumann’s *Kinderszenen* (Scenes of Childhood). As in Schumann’s work, the pieces that comprise *Elternszenen* are all of a single idea, and feature similar subjects: moods, situations, games etc. While some of the titles are self-explanatory others are less so: After the storm is the stillness after upset, when breathing becomes steady again; Twister™ is a game developed in the 1960s that, according to the manufacturer, ‘will tie you in knots’; The Box is about how packaging is often more stimulating than its contents – this short piece has eight very short sections: ‘The boot of a giant’, ‘A hiding place’, ‘A butterfly’, ‘A lost dog’, ‘The lost dog, now found, runs off with the box’, ‘A dress’, ‘A submarine’, ‘A washing machine (on spin)’ and ‘A spaceship’. 5,500 Days is when your child is less in the room and more of a distant presence somewhere else in the house.
