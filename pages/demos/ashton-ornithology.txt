PROGRAMME NOTE

-i. Cuckoo

-ii. Heron

-iii. O'ahu 'ō 'ō 

-iv. Goldfinch

v. Windhover

Five birds: two songbirds, one bird of prey, one waterbird, and one famous for its parasitic nesting behaviour. The flight and the songs of birds have always held a fascination for me, while the variety of their shapes, sizes and colours has inspired many artists and poets – and hunters – through history. The starting point for Ornithology is five poems chosen for their striking evocations of the birds they portray. Lines from the poems entitle each movement in what is a diverse and very colourful set, ranging from the ethereal through the elegiac to the dazzlingly brilliant. Two poems by Gerard Manley Hopkins bookend the set: his short stanza on the cuckoo known as ‘Fragment 146’ provides inspiration for the atmospheric opener, while the famous Windhover makes for a tour de force finale. In between, contemporary Dorset poet Elisabeth Bletsoe’s very personal responses to the Heron and Goldfinch sandwich a lament on the passing of the O‘ahu ‘ō‘ō, a stunning Hawaian bird from a genus entirely hunted to extinction for their colourful feathers.
