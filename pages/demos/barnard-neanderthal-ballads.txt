This is a set of pieces for piano inspired by descriptions and discoveries of Neanderthal culture. Hand Spirits is a musical expression of the images of the hand stencil images in ancient cave art that Neanderthals may have seen or even made themselves; A five-note ‘hand-print’ motif is surrounded and decorated by colour. Young Neanderthals play an energetic game in the second piece and Hearth Communion depicts a scene in William Golding’s novel The Inheritors in which a small family of Neanderthals are gathered around a fire in closely shared thought. The path through the forest to the edge of the sea traces a familiar route for Golding’s group who encounter Homo sapiens arriving by water. Feathered Dance imagines a ritual and the early emergence of spirituality and religion. 

The first identified Neanderthal bones were discovered in the Neander Valley in 1856. Nearby, Robert Schumann had died a few days earlier. The final piece is a meditation on the disappearance, resurrection and lasting presence of the Neanderthals; in the bones left in the ground and the DNA in our bodies. The end is a reference to the final disappearing chord note-by-note in Schumann’s Papillons Op.2.
