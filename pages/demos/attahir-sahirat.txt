!*Sahirat* was commissioned by the Royal Philharmonic Society for Clare Hammond as part of the Philip Langridge Mentoring Scheme.

PROGRAMME NOTE

‘Sahirat’ is the Arabic word for ‘witches’, and reflects the oriental character of the principal theme of this work. The rhythmic material is derived from a Morse translation of the opening of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the apparition of the three witches:

-FIRST WITCH: When shall we three meet again
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

-SECOND WITCH: When the hurlyburly’s done,
When the battle’s lost and won.

THIRD WITCH: That will be ere the set of sun. 

The influence of the Morse rhythm is clearest at the opening and close of the piece, though it permeates the entire work.
