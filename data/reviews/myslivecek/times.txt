Britain's excellent Clare Hammond, meanwhile, has been rummaging in the archives for keyboard music by the 18th-century composer Josef Myslivecek - hard to spell, harder to pronounce - who paved the way for Mozart, an admirer, and led a lustful cosmopolitan life.

Sprightliness abounds in the concertos and short pieces gathered here, delivered with deliciously unfussy poise and elegance on a modern Steinway, crisply supported by the Swedish Chamber Orchestra and the conductor Nicholas McGegan.
